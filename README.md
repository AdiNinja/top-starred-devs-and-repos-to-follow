> The Top Python GitHub Devs and Repos to Follow (All-Time and Trending)

## Why?

Why follow the top Python GitHub devs?

> Following influencers is usually a good practice. It has helped me in multiple ways:

> 1. Whenever I run out of inspiration, I look at these influencers and see what they have achieved. This brings back the energy and I am back on my projects

> 2. You can follow these influencers to see which events are they attending, what are they reading and what are they working on. This can quickly become a wealth of knowledge in itself.

> 3. To some extent, it also provides a human touch to these influencers. By just looking at their profiles, they might come across as some one out of the world. But, when you start folllowing them regularly, you tend to relate yourself with the influencers.

> Inspired by the following [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3e7lpo/top_data_scientists_to_follow_and_best_tutorials/).

After reading through the post, I was curious to see a similar list for Python GitHub devs and repos.

## 'Top'?

There's no definitive way to determine 'top' developers and repos. Every metric has its flaws. The lists below look at total number of stars in Python repositories, which seems to be a decent metric that is readily available/easy to mine.

Developer stats are for individual contributors. Not sure how you'd measure stats for developers part of an org or those contributing to other projects.

I found it interesting to track 'all time' and 'trending' developers/repos, so lists for each are included. Sources are provided after each list.

## Updates?

I'll update these lists at least once a week.

## Contributions?

Sure!  If there's interest in seeing similar lists in other programming languages, please file an issue or better yet, contribute.
