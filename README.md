> The Top-Starred Python GitHub Devs, Orgs, and Repos to Follow (All-Time and Trending)

## Why?

Why follow the top-starred Python GitHub devs?

> Following influencers is usually a good practice. It has helped me in multiple ways:

> 1. Whenever I run out of inspiration, I look at these influencers and see what they have achieved. This brings back the energy and I am back on my projects

> 2. You can follow these influencers to see which events are they attending, what are they reading and what are they working on. This can quickly become a wealth of knowledge in itself.

> 3. To some extent, it also provides a human touch to these influencers. By just looking at their profiles, they might come across as some one out of the world. But, when you start following them regularly, you tend to relate yourself with the influencers.

> Inspired by the following [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3e7lpo/top_data_scientists_to_follow_and_best_tutorials/).

After reading through the post, I was curious to see a similar list for Python GitHub devs, orgs, and repos.

## 'Top-Starred'?

There's no definitive way to determine 'top' devs, orgs, and repos by language. Every metric has its flaws. The lists below look at total number of stars in Python repositories, which seems to be a decent metric that is readily available/easy to mine.

Dev stats are for individual contributors. Org stats are also provided: viewing the org link shows the devs who are part of the org. Not sure how you'd measure stats for each dev part of an org, or similarly, devs contributing to other projects.

GitHub is not perfect in classifying repos as Python. The lists below try to manually filter out mis-classified repos.

I found it interesting to track 'all time' and 'trending' stats, so lists for each are included. Sources are provided after each list.
